Platform-specific module interface that provides user session and process management functionality on macOS systems.

## Key Components

- **Conditional compilation**: Uses `cfg` attributes to include macOS-specific implementations only when building for macOS targets
- **Public re-exports**: Exposes three core functions from the internal `macos` module:
  - `get_console_user` - Retrieves the currently logged-in console user
  - `launch_as_user` - Launches processes with specific user privileges
  - `is_process_running` - Checks if a process is currently running

## Usage Example

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
use your_crate::{get_console_user, launch_as_user, is_process_running};

#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
fn example_usage() {
    // Get the current console user
    if let Some(username) = get_console_user() {
        println!("Console user: {}", username);
        
        // Check if a process is running
        if is_process_running("some_process") {
            println!("Process is already running");
        } else {
            // Launch a process as the console user
            launch_as_user(&username, "/path/to/executable", &[]).ok();
        }
    }
}
```

This module serves as a platform abstraction layer, ensuring that macOS-specific functionality is only compiled and available when targeting macOS systems, while maintaining a clean public API for cross-platform code.
