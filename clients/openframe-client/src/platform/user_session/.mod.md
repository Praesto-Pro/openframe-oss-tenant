This module provides platform-specific user management functionality, currently supporting macOS with conditional compilation.

## Key Components

- **`macos` module** - Platform-specific implementation for macOS user operations
- **`get_console_user()`** - Retrieves the currently logged-in console user
- **`launch_as_user()`** - Launches processes under a specific user context

## Usage Example

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
use crate::user::{get_console_user, launch_as_user};

#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
fn example_usage() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Get the current console user
    let user = get_console_user()?;
    println!("Console user: {}", user);
    
    // Launch a process as the current user
    launch_as_user(&user, "open", &["-a", "TextEdit"])?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The module uses Rust's conditional compilation features (`#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`) to ensure the functionality is only available on macOS systems. This allows for clean platform-specific code organization while maintaining cross-platform compatibility in the broader application.
