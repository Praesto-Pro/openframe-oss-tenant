Utility module for locating PowerShell executables on Windows systems. Provides functions to find PowerShell installations by checking PATH first, then falling back to known system locations.

## Key Components

- `get_powershell_path()` - Main function that returns a ready-to-use PowerShell path string
- `find_powershell_path()` - Internal helper that searches known PowerShell installation directories

## Usage Example

```rust
use powershell::get_powershell_path;

// Get PowerShell path for executing commands
match get_powershell_path() {
    Ok(ps_path) => {
        println!("Found PowerShell at: {}", ps_path);
        // Use ps_path with Command::new() to run PowerShell scripts
    }
    Err(e) => {
        eprintln!("PowerShell not found: {}", e);
    }
}
```

The module prioritizes PowerShell availability in PATH over hardcoded locations and searches multiple installation paths including both Windows PowerShell (v1.0) and modern PowerShell 7 installations across different Program Files directories.
