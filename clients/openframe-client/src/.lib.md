The main entry point and service orchestrator for the OpenFrame agent client, providing unified access to all core services and managing their dependencies.

## Key Components

- **ClientConfiguration**: Configuration structs for server, client, metrics, and security settings
- **Client**: Main orchestrator that initializes and manages all services including:
  - Registration and authentication processors
  - NATS connection manager for real-time messaging
  - Tool installation and update listeners
  - Tool run and connection managers
  - Machine heartbeat services
  - Directory and file management services

## Usage Example

```rust
use openframe_agent_lib::{Client, ClientConfiguration};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create a new client instance
    let client = Client::new()?;
    
    // The client automatically initializes all required services:
    // - HTTP client with proper timeout and TLS settings
    // - Directory manager for file operations
    // - Registration and authentication processors
    // - NATS connection for real-time messaging
    // - Tool installation and update listeners
    // - Machine heartbeat services
    
    // Configuration is loaded from default or environment variables
    let config = ClientConfiguration::default();
    println!("Server URL: {}", config.server.url);
    println!("Update channel: {}", config.client.update_channel);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The Client struct handles dependency injection and service initialization, supporting both production and development modes through environment variables.
