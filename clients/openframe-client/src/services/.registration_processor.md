Orchestrates the agent registration process with automatic retry logic and machine ID validation for the Flamingo MSP platform.

## Key Components

- **`RegistrationProcessor`** - Main struct that handles agent registration workflow
- **`new()`** - Constructor accepting registration and configuration services
- **`process()`** - Public entry point that checks for existing machine ID and initiates registration loop
- **`attempt_registration()`** - Private method that performs a single registration attempt

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::{AgentRegistrationService, AgentConfigurationService};
use crate::processors::RegistrationProcessor;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let registration_service = AgentRegistrationService::new();
    let config_service = AgentConfigurationService::new();
    
    let processor = RegistrationProcessor::new(
        registration_service,
        config_service,
    );
    
    // Start registration process - will skip if machine_id exists
    processor.process().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The processor implements a smart registration flow: it first checks if a machine ID already exists to avoid duplicate registrations, then enters a retry loop with 60-second intervals if registration fails. The service dependencies are injected through the constructor, making it testable and modular within the Flamingo agent architecture.
