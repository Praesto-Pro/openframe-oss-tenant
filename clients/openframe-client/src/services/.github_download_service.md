This service handles downloading and extracting agent binaries from GitHub releases with robust error handling and platform-specific archive support. It provides automatic retry logic, CDN fallback for rate limits, and cross-platform compatibility for ZIP and tar.gz archives.

## Key Components

- **GithubDownloadService**: Main service struct with HTTP client
- **download_and_extract()**: Downloads and extracts binary from archive based on configuration
- **download_with_retry()**: Implements retry logic with jsDelivr CDN fallback for GitHub rate limits
- **extract_from_zip()**: Windows-specific ZIP archive extraction
- **extract_from_tar_gz()**: Unix-specific tar.gz archive extraction  
- **find_config_for_current_os()**: Selects appropriate download configuration for current platform
- **download_and_save()**: Complete download and file save operation

## Usage Example

```rust
use reqwest::Client;

// Initialize the service
let client = Client::new();
let service = GithubDownloadService::new(client);

// Find configuration for current OS
let config = service.find_config_for_current_os(&download_configs)?;

// Download and extract binary
let binary_bytes = service.download_and_extract(config).await?;

// Or download and save directly to disk
let executable_path = service.download_and_save(
    config,
    &tool_folder_path,
    &default_agent_path
).await?;
```

The service automatically handles GitHub rate limiting by falling back to jsDelivr CDN, validates file sizes, and sets appropriate executable permissions on Unix systems. It supports both single binary extraction and full folder extraction depending on configuration.
