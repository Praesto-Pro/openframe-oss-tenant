Provides tool installation and management functionality for the Flamingo AI platform, handling downloads from multiple sources, reinstallation, and executable configuration across different operating systems.

## Key Components

**Main Service:**
- `ToolInstallationService` - Central service orchestrating tool installation workflow with dependency injection for all required services

**Core Methods:**
- `install()` - Main installation method handling tool download, extraction, and configuration
- `install_from_download_config()` - Processes platform-specific download configurations  
- `download_from_artifactory()` - Downloads tools from internal Artifactory repository
- `resolve_executable_path()` - Determines final executable location based on installation type

**Asset Management:**
- Multi-source asset downloading (Artifactory, Tool API, GitHub)
- Platform-specific file permissions and executable flags
- Asset caching to avoid redundant downloads

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::ToolInstallationService;
use crate::models::ToolInstallationMessage;

// Initialize service with all dependencies
let installation_service = ToolInstallationService::new(
    github_service,
    file_client,
    api_client,
    command_resolver,
    url_resolver,
    tools_service,
    directory_manager,
    run_manager,
    connection_manager,
    config_service,
    publisher,
    connection_service,
);

// Install a tool
let install_message = ToolInstallationMessage {
    tool_agent_id: "example-tool".to_string(),
    version: "1.0.0".to_string(),
    reinstall: false,
    // ... other fields
};

installation_service.install(install_message).await?;
```

The service handles complex scenarios including tool reinstallation (with process termination and cleanup), cross-platform executable permissions, and asset dependency resolution with URL parameter substitution.
