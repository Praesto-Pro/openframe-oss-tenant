<!-- source-hash: ee871f769388c1fe0fa6b4594efdead7 -->
A Rust service that handles the complete lifecycle of tool installation, including downloading from multiple sources, managing assets, and handling reinstallation scenarios within the Flamingo MSP platform.

## Key Components

- **ToolInstallationService**: Main service struct orchestrating tool installation workflows
- **install()**: Primary method handling tool installation, reinstallation, and asset management
- **download_from_artifactory()**: Downloads tools from the artifactory source
- **set_executable_permissions()**: Platform-specific permission management for executable files
- **Multi-source asset handling**: Supports GitHub, Artifactory, and Tool API downloads
- **Dependency injection**: Integrates with 12+ specialized services for complete tool management

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::tool_installation_service::ToolInstallationService;
use crate::models::ToolInstallationMessage;

// Create service with all dependencies
let installation_service = ToolInstallationService::new(
    github_download_service,
    tool_agent_file_client,
    tool_api_client,
    command_params_resolver,
    url_params_resolver,
    installed_tools_service,
    directory_manager,
    tool_run_manager,
    tool_connection_processing_manager,
    config_service,
    installed_agent_publisher,
    tool_connection_service,
);

// Install a new tool
let message = ToolInstallationMessage {
    tool_agent_id: "my-tool".to_string(),
    version: "1.0.0".to_string(),
    reinstall: false,
    // ... other fields
};

installation_service.install(message).await?;
```

The service handles complex scenarios like stopping running processes during reinstall, managing OS-specific executables, and coordinating with multiple backend services to ensure reliable tool deployment across the Flamingo platform.
