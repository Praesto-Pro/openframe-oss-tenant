A Next.js page component that renders the schedule creation interface within the application layout, configured for dynamic rendering to ensure fresh data on each request.

## Key Components

- **CreateSchedulePage**: Default exported React component that serves as the page entry point
- **AppLayout**: Wrapper component providing consistent application structure and navigation
- **ScheduleCreateView**: Core component handling the schedule creation functionality and form interface
- **dynamic**: Export configuration forcing dynamic rendering instead of static generation

## Usage Example

This page is automatically routed by Next.js based on its file location. The component structure follows a typical layout pattern:

```typescript
// Rendered page structure
<AppLayout>
  {/* App navigation, header, sidebar etc. */}
  <ScheduleCreateView />
  {/* Schedule creation form and controls */}
</AppLayout>
```

The `'use client'` directive indicates this is a client-side component that can use React hooks and browser APIs. The `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` export ensures the page is server-rendered on each request rather than being statically generated, which is important for schedule creation pages that may need real-time data or user-specific content.
