A React component for scheduling script execution on selected devices with form validation and device filtering capabilities.

## Key Components

- **ScheduleScriptView**: Main component that provides a comprehensive interface for scheduling scripts
- **scheduleFormSchema**: Zod validation schema for form data including timeout, arguments, environment variables, and scheduling options
- **parseKeyValues/serializeKeyValues**: Utility functions for converting between key-value pairs and string arrays
- **Device Selection**: Multi-select interface with search and organization filtering
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form integration with validation and error handling

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ScheduleScriptView } from './schedule-script-view'

// Use in a page component
function ScheduleScriptPage({ params }: { params: { scriptId: string } }) {
  return <ScheduleScriptView scriptId={params.scriptId} />
}

// The component handles:
// - Loading script details and available devices
// - Form validation for scheduling parameters
// - Device selection with search and filtering
// - Creating scheduled tasks via Tactical API
// - Navigation back to script details on completion
```

The component integrates with the Tactical RMM API to create scheduled tasks, supports both one-time and recurring schedules, and provides comprehensive error handling with toast notifications. It includes responsive design considerations and handles cross-platform script execution requirements.
