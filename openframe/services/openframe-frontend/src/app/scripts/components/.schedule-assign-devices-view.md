This React component provides a comprehensive interface for assigning devices to scheduled script execution in the OpenFrame MSP platform. It allows users to view, search, and manage device assignments for automated script schedules.

## Key Components

**Main Component:**
- `ScheduleAssignDevicesView` - Primary view component for device assignment interface

**Helper Components:**
- `DeviceTabContent` - Renders tabbed content for available/selected devices
- `ScheduleAssignDevicesLoader` - Loading state component
- `ScheduleInfoBarFromData` - Displays schedule information

**Core Functions:**
- `fetchDevicesByPlatforms()` - Retrieves devices filtered by OS platforms
- `toggleDevice()` - Adds/removes devices from selection
- `handleSave()` - Persists device assignments to schedule

**State Management:**
- Device selection tracking with Set-based state
- Search filtering functionality
- Tab navigation between available/selected devices
- Integration with TanStack Query for data fetching

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Use in a page component for schedule device assignment
import { ScheduleAssignDevicesView } from './schedule-assign-devices-view'

export default function AssignDevicesPage({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: { scheduleId: string } 
}) {
  return (
    <ScheduleAssignDevicesView 
      scheduleId={params.scheduleId} 
    />
  )
}

// The component automatically:
// - Loads current schedule and assigned devices
// - Filters devices by platform compatibility
// - Provides search and selection interface
// - Handles bulk add/remove operations
// - Saves changes via GraphQL mutations
```

The component integrates with Tactical RMM for device management and provides a responsive interface for MSP technicians to efficiently assign devices to automated script schedules.
