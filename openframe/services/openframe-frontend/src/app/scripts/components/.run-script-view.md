<!-- source-hash: 516acab59bd939a85217396cf556a5f7 -->
A React component that provides a comprehensive interface for executing scripts across multiple devices with configurable parameters and device selection.

## Key Components

- **RunScriptView**: Main component that manages script execution workflow
- **runFormSchema**: Zod validation schema for form data (timeout, script arguments, environment variables)
- **RunFormData**: TypeScript interface for form state
- Custom hooks integration:
  - `useRunScriptData`: Fetches script details and available devices
  - `useDeviceFilter`: Manages device filtering and organization selection
  - `useDeviceSelection`: Handles multi-device selection state

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { RunScriptView } from './run-script-view'

// Render script execution interface
function ScriptExecutionPage() {
  return (
    <RunScriptView scriptId="script-123" />
  )
}

// Component handles:
// - Loading script details and devices
// - Form validation for timeout and parameters
// - Device filtering and selection
// - Script execution via Tactical API
// - Success/error feedback with modals
```

The component provides a complete script execution workflow including parameter configuration, device selection with filtering, form validation, API integration with the Tactical RMM system, and user feedback through toasts and modals. It automatically resolves OS types and shell execution contexts based on selected devices and script requirements.
