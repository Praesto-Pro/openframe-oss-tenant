<!-- source-hash: 1d7bdb31a520e4547a7ea7cb5fdea5a4 -->
A React component that provides a comprehensive interface for running scripts on selected devices, featuring device search, selection management, and script execution capabilities.

## Key Components

- **RunScriptView**: Main component that handles script execution workflow
- **useRunScriptData**: Custom hook for fetching script details and device data
- **Device Selection Logic**: Multi-device selection with search and filtering
- **Script Execution Handler**: Processes bulk script execution via Tactical RMM API
- **UI Components**: Integrates SearchBar, SelectableDeviceCard, and DetailPageContainer

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { RunScriptView } from './run-script-view'

// Render script execution interface
function ScriptRunPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  return <RunScriptView scriptId={params.id} />
}

// The component handles:
// - Loading script details and compatible devices
// - Device search with 300ms debouncing
// - Multi-device selection management
// - OS-specific script execution logic
// - Error handling and user feedback via toasts
```

The component automatically normalizes operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) for script compatibility, manages agent IDs for Tactical RMM integration, and provides real-time feedback during script submission. It includes responsive grid layouts for device cards and comprehensive error states for loading failures.
