<!-- source-hash: 31cff01ad332a67af28b54168e83dfc5 -->
A React component for creating and editing script schedules with form validation, platform selection, and recurring execution options.

## Key Components

- **ScheduleCreateView**: Main component handling schedule creation/editing with form management
- **Form Controls**: Integration with React Hook Form for validation and state management
- **Platform Selection**: Multi-platform support with visual platform toggles
- **Action Management**: Dynamic array of script actions with add/remove functionality
- **Repeat Configuration**: Optional recurring schedule setup with intervals and periods
- **Mutation Hooks**: Create and update operations with optimistic UI updates

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create new schedule
<ScheduleCreateView />

// Edit existing schedule
<ScheduleCreateView scheduleId="schedule-123" />

// Form validation schema
const formData: CreateScheduleFormData = {
  name: 'Daily Backup',
  scheduledDate: new Date(),
  repeatEnabled: true,
  repeatInterval: 1,
  repeatPeriod: 'day',
  supportedPlatforms: ['windows', 'linux'],
  actions: [{
    script: 123,
    name: 'Backup Script',
    timeout: 90,
    script_args: [],
    env_vars: []
  }]
}
```

The component validates platform compatibility between selected scripts and supported platforms, provides real-time form feedback, and handles both creation and update workflows with proper navigation and toast notifications.
