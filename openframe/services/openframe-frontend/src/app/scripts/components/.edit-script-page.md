<!-- source-hash: 39aa7ebce27df6c41ff11255e8927e59 -->
A React component that provides a comprehensive interface for creating and editing automation scripts, featuring form management, test execution, and device selection capabilities.

## Key Components

- **EditScriptPage**: Main component handling both create and edit modes for scripts
- **Form Management**: Integrates with `useEditScriptForm` hook for script data handling
- **Test Execution**: Manages script testing via `useTestRuns` hook and device selection
- **Modal Interface**: Includes `TestScriptModal` for device selection during testing
- **Error Handling**: Displays loading states and error messages for failed operations
- **Navigation**: Contextual back button behavior based on create/edit mode

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create new script
<EditScriptPage scriptId={null} />

// Edit existing script
<EditScriptPage scriptId="script-123" />

// The component handles:
// - Loading script details in edit mode
// - Form validation and submission
// - Test execution with device selection
// - Error states and loading indicators
```

The component uses `FormPageContainer` for consistent layout and provides actions for testing and saving scripts. It watches form changes to enable/disable the save button and manages test run display with real-time output cards. The test modal allows platform-specific device selection for script validation.
