A Next.js page component that renders the Scripts functionality within the application layout, configured for dynamic server-side rendering.

## Key Components

- **Scripts** - Default exported page component that combines the app layout with scripts functionality
- **dynamic** - Export configuration forcing dynamic rendering to ensure fresh data on each request
- **AppLayout** - Wrapper component providing consistent navigation and page structure
- **ScriptsView** - Main content component handling the scripts interface and logic

## Usage Example

```typescript
// This page is automatically routed by Next.js based on file location
// Access via: /scripts

import { Scripts } from './page'

// The page renders with dynamic content
<Scripts />
// Results in:
// <AppLayout>
//   <ScriptsView />
// </AppLayout>
```

The `'use client'` directive makes this a client-side component, while `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` ensures the page is rendered fresh on each request rather than being statically generated. This is typically used when the scripts data needs to be current and may change frequently.
