A React Query mutation hook that archives resolved dialogs with optimistic updates and comprehensive error handling.

## Key Components

- **useArchiveResolvedMutation()** - Main hook that returns a mutation for archiving resolved dialogs
- **mutationFn** - Filters resolved dialogs and makes parallel PATCH requests to archive them
- **onMutate** - Implements optimistic updates by removing dialogs from cache immediately
- **onError** - Reverts optimistic updates and shows appropriate error toasts
- **onSuccess** - Shows success toast with count of archived/failed dialogs
- **onSettled** - Invalidates dialog queries to refresh data

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useArchiveResolvedMutation } from './use-archive-resolved-mutation'

function DialogManager() {
  const archiveResolvedMutation = useArchiveResolvedMutation()

  const handleArchiveResolved = (dialogs: Dialog[]) => {
    archiveResolvedMutation.mutate(dialogs)
  }

  return (
    <button 
      onClick={() => handleArchiveResolved(selectedDialogs)}
      disabled={archiveResolvedMutation.isPending}
    >
      {archiveResolvedMutation.isPending ? 'Archiving...' : 'Archive Resolved'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

The hook automatically filters for resolved dialogs, provides immediate UI feedback through optimistic updates, handles partial failures gracefully, and maintains data consistency through proper query invalidation.
