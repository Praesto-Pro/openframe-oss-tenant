A React component that displays a dashboard overview of device statistics with loading states and interactive cards for online/offline device counts.

## Key Components

- **DevicesOverviewSection** - Main component that renders device statistics overview
- **useDevicesOverview** - Custom hook for fetching device statistics data
- **DashboardInfoCard** - Reusable card component for displaying metrics
- **Skeleton** - Loading state component from the core UI library

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { DevicesOverviewSection } from './devices-overview'

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <DevicesOverviewSection />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles loading states with skeleton placeholders and displays:
- Total device count with formatted numbers
- Online devices card with percentage and link to filtered view
- Offline devices card with percentage and link to filtered view

Cards include progress indicators and navigate to filtered device lists when clicked. The layout is responsive, adapting from single column on mobile to three columns on large screens.
