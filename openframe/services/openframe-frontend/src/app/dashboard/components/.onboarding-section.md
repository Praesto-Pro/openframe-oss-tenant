A React component that renders an onboarding walkthrough for the OpenFrame dashboard, guiding users through essential setup steps like organizations, devices, team management, SSO configuration, and knowledge base access.

## Key Components

- **OnboardingSection**: Main component that orchestrates the onboarding experience
- **onboardingSteps**: Configuration array defining five key setup steps with icons, descriptions, and actions
- **Navigation handlers**: Callback functions for routing users to appropriate configuration pages
- **useOnboardingCompletion**: Hook integration for tracking completion status across steps

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OnboardingSection } from './onboarding-section'

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <h1>Welcome to OpenFrame</h1>
      <OnboardingSection />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically tracks completion status and provides guided navigation to:
- Organization setup (`/organizations/edit/new`)
- Device management (`/devices/new`) 
- Team configuration (`/settings?tab=company-and-users`)
- SSO setup (`/settings?tab=sso-configuration`)
- External knowledge base (opens in new tab)

Each step includes visual icons from the OpenFrame core library and maintains completion state using the `openframe-dashboard-onboarding` storage key.
