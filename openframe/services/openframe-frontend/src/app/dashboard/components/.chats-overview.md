A React dashboard component that displays a comprehensive overview of chat statistics with loading states and responsive grid layout.

## Key Components

- **`ChatsOverviewSection`** - Main component that renders chat metrics in a dashboard card grid
- **Loading State** - Displays skeleton placeholders while data is fetching
- **Data Display** - Shows total chats, active/resolved counts with percentages, and performance metrics

## Dependencies

- `DashboardInfoCard` and `Skeleton` from `@flamingo-stack/openframe-frontend-core`
- `useChatsOverview` hook for chat statistics data

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ChatsOverviewSection } from './chats-overview'

export function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <ChatsOverviewSection />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles loading states with skeleton UI and displays four key metrics: active chats, resolved chats, average resolve time, and average Fae rating. All cards link to the `/mingo` route for detailed chat management. The layout is fully responsive, adapting from single column on mobile to four columns on large screens.
