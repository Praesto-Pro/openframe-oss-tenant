A React component that displays a dashboard overview of organizations with their device statistics, featuring organization cards alongside active and inactive device metrics in a responsive grid layout.

## Key Components

- **OrganizationsOverviewSection**: Main component that renders the organizations overview dashboard
- **OrganizationsSkeleton**: Loading state component that shows placeholder cards while data is fetching
- **useOrganizationsOverview**: Custom hook for fetching organization data (imported)
- **OrganizationCard**: Displays organization info with image, name, and total device count
- **DashboardInfoCard**: Shows device statistics (online/offline) with progress bars and clickable links

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OrganizationsOverviewSection } from './organizations-overview'

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-6">
      <OrganizationsOverviewSection />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles loading states with skeleton placeholders, error states with error messages, and renders a responsive grid (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop). Each organization row contains three cards: the organization card (clickable to view devices), active devices card, and offline devices card - both with clickable links that filter devices by status and organization.
