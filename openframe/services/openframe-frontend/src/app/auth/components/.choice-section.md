A React component that provides a dual-form interface for creating organizations and signing into existing ones, with SaaS and self-hosted mode support.

## Key Components

- **AuthChoiceSection**: Main component with create organization and sign-in forms
- **Form validation**: Email regex, organization name validation, domain checking
- **SaaS mode handling**: Access code validation, domain availability checking
- **State management**: Multiple form states, loading states, error handling
- **Integration hooks**: Toast notifications, forgot password modal

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AuthChoiceSection } from './choice-section'

function AuthPage() {
  const handleCreateOrganization = async (orgName: string, domain: string, accessCode: string, email: string) => {
    // Handle organization creation
    console.log('Creating org:', { orgName, domain, accessCode, email })
  }

  const handleSignIn = async (email: string) => {
    // Handle user sign in
    console.log('Signing in:', email)
  }

  return (
    <AuthChoiceSection
      onCreateOrganization={handleCreateOrganization}
      onSignIn={handleSignIn}
      isLoading={false}
    />
  )
}
```

The component automatically adapts between SaaS shared mode (requiring access codes and domain validation) and self-hosted mode. It includes comprehensive form validation, domain availability checking, suggested alternatives for taken domains, and integrated error handling with toast notifications.
