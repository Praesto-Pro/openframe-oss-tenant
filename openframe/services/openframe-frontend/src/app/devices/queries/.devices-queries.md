GraphQL query definitions for device management operations in the Flamingo MSP platform, providing comprehensive device filtering, pagination, and data retrieval capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GET_DEVICE_FILTERS_QUERY** - Retrieves available filter options with counts for device statuses, types, OS types, organizations, and tags
- **GET_DEVICES_QUERY** - Main query for paginated device listing with full device details, tool connections, and organization information
- **GET_DEVICE_QUERY** - Fetches complete details for a single device by machine ID, including installed agents and metadata
- **GET_DEVICES_OVERVIEW_QUERY** - Lightweight query for device status overview and pagination metadata

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GET_DEVICES_QUERY, GET_DEVICE_FILTERS_QUERY } from './devices-queries'

// Fetch filtered devices with pagination
const devicesResult = await graphqlClient.query({
  query: GET_DEVICES_QUERY,
  variables: {
    filter: { 
      statuses: ['online', 'offline'],
      organizationIds: ['org-123']
    },
    pagination: { first: 20, after: 'cursor123' },
    search: 'laptop',
    sort: { field: 'lastSeen', direction: 'DESC' }
  }
})

// Get filter options for UI dropdowns
const filtersResult = await graphqlClient.query({
  query: GET_DEVICE_FILTERS_QUERY,
  variables: {
    filter: { organizationIds: ['org-123'] }
  }
})
```

These queries support the OpenFrame unified platform's device management interface, enabling MSP technicians to efficiently monitor, filter, and manage client devices across multiple organizations.
