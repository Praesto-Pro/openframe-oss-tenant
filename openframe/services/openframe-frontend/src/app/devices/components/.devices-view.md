A React component that provides a dual-view (table/grid) interface for managing devices with advanced filtering, search, and cursor-based pagination capabilities.

## Key Components

- **DevicesView**: Main component orchestrating the devices listing interface
- **ViewToggle**: Switches between table and grid display modes
- **Table/DevicesGrid**: Conditional rendering based on selected view mode
- **ListPageLayout**: Wrapper providing consistent page structure and mobile filtering
- **Device Management**: Row actions for device operations and navigation to details

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { DevicesView } from './devices-view'

// Used in a Next.js page or route
export default function DevicesPage() {
  return <DevicesView />
}

// The component handles all device listing functionality including:
// - URL-based filtering by status, OS type, and organization
// - Search with cursor pagination
// - Table/grid view toggle
// - Navigation to device details and creation
```

The component integrates with the OpenFrame UI system and uses specialized hooks for API parameter management (`useApiParams`), cursor pagination (`useCursorPaginationState`), and device data fetching (`useDevices`). It supports both desktop table views with advanced filtering and mobile-optimized layouts with responsive filter panels.
