A React container component that provides a complete file management interface for remote devices in the Flamingo/OpenFrame ecosystem, integrating with MeshCentral for remote file operations.

## Key Components

- **FileManagerContainer** - Main component that orchestrates file management for remote devices
- **Modal Integration** - Manages new folder, rename, and delete confirmation modals
- **Progress Tracking** - Displays upload/download progress with cancellation options
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Supports Ctrl+C/X/V for clipboard operations and Delete for file removal
- **Search Functionality** - Provides file search with query state management
- **Connection States** - Handles different connection states with appropriate loading indicators

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FileManagerContainer } from './file-manager-container'

function DeviceFileManager() {
  return (
    <FileManagerContainer
      deviceId="device-123"
      meshcentralAgentId="agent-456"
      hostname="my-server.local"
      organizationName="Acme Corp"
    />
  )
}

// The component handles all file operations automatically:
// - Navigation through folder structure
// - File upload/download with progress tracking
// - Search across remote file system
// - Cut/copy/paste operations
// - Folder creation and file renaming
// - Bulk file selection and deletion
```

The component uses the `useMeshFileManager` hook for remote file operations and provides a complete file management experience with breadcrumb navigation, file selection, and comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for power users.
