Main entry point for OpenFrame's test execution framework that orchestrates sequential test runs across different functional areas. The application runs registration, OSS, and password reset tests in a specific order with built-in failure handling.

## Key Components

- **Main Method**: Entry point that handles command-line arguments and orchestrates test execution
- **TestRunner**: Core testing engine that executes test suites by tag/category
- **Sequential Execution**: Runs tests in order: registration → OSS → password reset
- **Failure Handling**: Stops execution if registration tests fail (unless skipped)
- **Exit Codes**: Returns 0 for success, 1 for any test failures

## Usage Example

```java
// Run all tests including registration
java -cp target/classes com.openframe.test.TestApplication

// Skip registration tests and run OSS + password reset only
java -cp target/classes com.openframe.test.TestApplication skipRegistration
```

The application uses JUnit Platform's test execution framework to run categorized tests from the `com.openframe.test.tests` package. Each test category is executed using tags ("registration", "oss", "reset") and results are logged with detailed summaries. Registration tests act as a prerequisite - if they fail, subsequent tests are skipped to prevent cascading failures in dependent functionality.
